      <h4 class="text-center">Respect</h4>
      <p>Receiving respect from others is important because it helps us to feel safe and to express ourselves.
Being respected by important people in our lives growing up teaches us how to be respectful toward others. Respect means that you accept somebody for who they are, even when they’re different from you or you don’t agree with them. Respect in your relationships builds feelings of trust, safety, and wellbeing.  Respect doesn’t have to come naturally – it is something you learn.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center">Honour</h4>
      <p>Honour is the idea of a bond between an individual and a society as a quality of a person that is both of social teaching and of personal ethos, that manifests itself as a code of conduct, and has various elements such as valor, chivalry, honesty, and compassion. It is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or institution such as a family, school, regiment or nation.</p>
